# bracket
 still in progress
either enter a list of players and ratings (ratings not required) and select an option for if you want the tournament to be seeded based on ranking or not
If not seeded, the players will be randomly generated into a bracket including randomly generated byes based on the number of players
For example, if there are 9 players, there will be 7 players receiving byes and one match between the last 2 players
If the tournament is seeded, it will be the lowest ranked two players facing each other in the "play-in" match, if not, it will be at random
Enter the winners of the matches in order to populate the rest of the bracket
Results will be outputted to a log in a txt file


In progress:

1. Entering the winner of any match, not necessarily in order
2. a GUI to neatly display the bracket and results
3. ability to enter scores of matches and set the game length for each bracket
4. create multiple brackets
